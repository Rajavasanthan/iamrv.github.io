        As a passionate technology geek and mentor, I have a strong interest in
        film making and 3D animation. In my daily life, I interact with a
        diverse group of students and am always looking for ways to share my
        knowledge and experience with others.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        In addition to my work as a mentor, I am also the founder of a company
        called Grids and Guides, which is dedicated to helping people leverage
        technology in innovative and meaningful ways.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        I am also the creator of a community called Each One Teach One, which is
        focused on building a network of individuals who are committed to
        sharing their skills and expertise with one another.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0 leading-relaxed">
        Overall, I am driven by a desire to constantly learn, grow, and make a
        positive impact on the world through my work in technology and film. I
        am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with others and
        make a difference.
