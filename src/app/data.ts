    summary: `In this article, I share my experience using a stable diffusion AI model to create a new and different look for myself. I explain how the model works and how easy it was for me to use, thanks to the guidance provided by my brother Dhuriyothanan. I also highlight the benefits of using stable diffusion, such as its ability to create natural and flattering poses, spot-on lighting, and the ability to experiment with different looks and styles. Overall, this article is a personal account of how I used the stable diffusion AI model to enhance my images and how it can be a powerful tool for anyone who wants to experiment with their own photos.`,

    summary: `I met an older software developer named Gopalakrishnan who had been learning new technologies from my videos. He shared with me his background as a successful developer in the 90s but struggled to adapt to new technologies. I was impressed by his determination to improve his skills and shared my knowledge on modern software development practices and SaaS platforms. It was a reminder that it's never too late to learn and grow in the tech industry. I will continue to create and share knowledge through my videos to help others like Gopalakrishnan.`,

    summary: `I have recently led a successful 2-day seminar on HTML and CSS at Paiylagam Institute, where the students were attentive and interactive. The instructor effectively imparted their knowledge of web development to the students, who actively participated in hands-on exercises and a real-world project. At the end of each day, the instructor held a fun review game to reinforce the material learned, creating a balanced and enjoyable learning experience. The seminar was a resounding success and the instructor looks forward to leading more seminars in the future.`,
